🎮 Doom Python (Doom-Inspired Ray Casting Engine)

A Doom-inspired 2.5D game engine built entirely in Python, recreating the classic retro FPS feel using ray-casting techniques.
This project is an educational clone inspired by DOOM (1993), focused on understanding game engine fundamentals rather than replicating the full game.

🧠 About the Project

This project simulates a pseudo-3D environment by projecting 2D map data into a first-person view using ray casting, the same core concept used in early FPS engines like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D.

It was built to explore:

How early FPS engines worked

Real-time rendering using math & geometry

Player movement, rotation, and collision detection

Game loops and event handling in Python

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Library: Pygame

Rendering Technique: Ray Casting (2.5D Engine)

🚀 Features

🎯 First-person Doom-style movement

🧱 Ray-casted wall rendering with depth perception

🎮 Smooth keyboard-based controls

🧠 Lightweight and educational game engine

🕹 Retro FPS visual style

🎮 Controls
Key	Action
W	Move Forward
S	Move Backward
A	Move Left
D	Move Right
Rotate Camera using Mouse
ESC	Quit Game

▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:RELXOP/doom-python.git
cd doom-python

2️⃣ Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install pygame

4️⃣ Run the game
python main.py

📌 Future Improvements

Textured walls & sprites
